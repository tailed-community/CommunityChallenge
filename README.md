Welcome to the first challenge of our student community learning initiative!

## 🔍 Challenge #1 – GitHub File Scraper

Your goal is to build a Python script that fetches and prints the raw content of any file on GitHub, given its URL.

### 🎯 Task Description

Create a script that:
1. Accepts a GitHub file URL (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/path/to/file.py`)
2. Converts it into the corresponding raw file URL
3. Fetches the content using the `requests` library
4. Prints the raw code in the terminal

### 🛠 Starter Template

Use the python file github_scraper.py to start the idea and show us what you are able to do!

### 💡 Ideas to Go Further

- Make a simple interface to show the scrape data
- Handle more edge cases or invalid URLs
- Scrape multiple files from a list
- Process the data via a ML model

We encourage you to modify it creatively and share your version with the community!
